## Library Simplified Documentation

To see screenshots, read in-depth documentation, and find out more about the project, check out the [Confluence](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/) site hosted by The New York Public Library.

## Setup

This package is meant to be used with the Library Simplified [Circulation Manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation).

#### Use npm version

Suggested local folder setup:
- `/[path to project folder]/circulation`

To use the published version with your circulation manager, run `npm install` from `api/admin` in the `circulation` local installed repository.

#### Use local development version

Suggested local folder setup:
- `/[path to project folder]/circulation`
- `/[path to project folder]/circulation-web`

If you're working on the administrative interface and want to test local changes, you can link your local clone of this repository to your local circulation manager. These steps will allow you to work on the front-end administrative interface and see updates while developing.

1. Run `npm link` in this `circulation-web` repository,
2. run `npm link simplified-circulation-web` from `api/admin` in the `circulation` repository,
2. run the circulation manager using `python app.py` at the root in the `circulation` repository,
3. run the web interface using `npm run dev` at the root of this `circulation-web` repository,
4. visit `localhost:6500/admin/`

Webpack will take care of compiling and updating any new changes made locally for development. Just refresh the page to see updates without having to restart either the `circulation` or `circulation-web` servers.

## Web Catalog

The Circulation Manager administrative interface relies on the [OPDS Web Catalog](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/opds-web-client) as its base React component and application. For more information, please check out the repository.

## Publishing

This package is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplified-circulation-web).

To publish a new version, you need to create an npm account and be a collaborator on the package. Then you can run `npm publish` from your local copy of the repository.

## Tests

Like the codebase, all the unit tests are written in Typescript. Tests are written for all React components as well as redux and utility functions, and all can be found in their respective `__tests__` folders.

To run the tests, perform `npm test`.

We use Travis CI for continuous integration. Any pull requests submitted must have tests and those tests must pass on Travis CI.
