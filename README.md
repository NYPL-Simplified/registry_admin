## Local Development & Installation

This project is a React app bundled with parcel.

One the repo is cloned, change directory to `registry_admin` and then install the dependencies.

```sh
cd registry_admin
npm install
```

## Accessibility

In order to develop user interfaces that are accessible to everyone, there are tools added to the workflow. Besides the Typescript `tslint-react-a11y` plugin, `react-axe` is also installed for local development. Using that module while running the app uses a lot of resources so it should be only when specifically testing for accessibility and not while actively developing new features or fixing bugs.

In order to run the app with `react-axe`, run `npm run dev-test-axe`. This will add a local global variable `process.env.TEST_AXE` (through webpack) that will trigger `react-axe` in `/src/index.tsx`. The output will be seen in the _browser's_ console terminal.

## Tests

Like the codebase, all the unit tests are written in Typescript. Tests are written for all React components as well as redux and utility functions, and all can be found in their respective `__tests__` folders.

To run the tests, perform `npm test`.

We use Travis CI for continuous integration. Any pull requests submitted must have tests and those tests must pass on Travis CI.

Manual tests and expectations for the Registry Admin's functionality can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9joHeNZpkTsZU-u1NwPBRUFYcxvRo23eP2vw79xPG4/edit#gid=0).

## Docker

We build a docker image and push it to AWS for QA and production environments. Sometimes you'll need to build the image locally for testing or debugging.

To build the docker image locally, run

```
docker build -t registryadmin --build-arg REGISTRY_API_DOMAIN=https://qa-libraryregistry.librarysimplified.org/admin .
```

To run the docker image, run

```
docker run -p 1234:1234 registryadmin:latest
```
